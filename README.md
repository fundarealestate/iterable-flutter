## Installation

1. Add `iterable_flutter` as a plugin in `pubspec.yaml` with the version you need like this:

```yaml
iterable_flutter: 0.5.4
```

2. Use `IterableFlutter.initialize` to set your iterable keys.

> First, create a mobile API Key from [Iterable](https://support.iterable.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043464871#creating-api-keys).
> Then, also from Iterable, [create a mobile app](https://support.iterable.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000331943#_2-create-a-mobile-app-in-iterable) and [assign a push integration](https://support.iterable.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000331943#_3-assign-a-push-integration-to-the-mobile-app)
to it.

```dart
class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();

    IterableFlutter.initialize(
      apiKey: <api-key>,
      pushIntegrationName: <name>,
    );
  }
}
```

3. Identify the user

> The identification can be done either using `IterableFlutter.setEmail` or `IterableFlutter.setUserId` methods.
> Don't set an email and user ID in the same session, doing so causes the SDK to treat them as different users.

4. Call `IterableFlutter.registerForPush` to register the device for current user and listen for opened pushes with `IterableFlutter.setNotificationOpenedHandler`

5. Track your events and optional data fields, call `IterableFlutter.track` method.
